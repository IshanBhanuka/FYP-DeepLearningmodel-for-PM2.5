# Spatial-Temporal Deep Learning Model for Predicting Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5) in Sri Lankan Urban Cities

## Description
This project focuses on predicting air pollution levels, specifically Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5), in urban areas of Sri Lanka. Using spatial-temporal deep learning models, satellite imagery, and sensor data, we aim to develop a comprehensive framework for forecasting PM2.5 levels and identifying potential sources of pollution.

## Usage
1. Run the main script from the relevant model.
2. Follow the prompts to input data and generate predictions.

## Data Sources
- Sensor data collected from 18 stations distributed across Sri Lanka.
- Satellite imagery for spatial analysis and feature extraction.

## File Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets and preprocessing scripts.
- `models/`: Directory containing trained deep learning models and the results gained from each model.
- The final Report of Part I of the project is [here.](https://github.com/IshanBhanuka/FYP-DeepLearningmodel-for-PM2.5/blob/main/G11_EE_405_Report.pdf)  


## Conclusion and Future Work
In our study, various methods for forecasting PM2.5 concentration in 3 clusters were compared. The results show that LSTM is the most accurate and reliable model for PM2.5 prediction for our dataset. We plan to further enhance our machine learning and deep learning models by fine-tuning hyperparameters, exploring different architectures, and incorporating new techniques. Additionally, we aim to develop a hybrid model that combines satellite imagery and advanced deep-learning techniques to predict PM2.5 levels in areas without sensor networks. Continuous monitoring and analysis of air quality patterns will be essential for ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of our predictive models over time.
